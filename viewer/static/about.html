  <p>This site provides an alternative way of browsing the <a
  href="http://sfpl.org/index.php">SFPL</a>'s incredible <a
  href="http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=0200000301">San Francisco Historical
  Photograph Collection</a>. Its goal is to help you discover the history
  behind the places you see every day.</p>
  
  <p>And, if you're lucky, maybe you'll even discover something about San
  Francisco's rich past that you never knew before!</p>

  <h3 style="clear: right; padding-top: 5px;">Where did these images come from?</h3>

  <p>
  The images all come from the San Francisco Public Library's <a
  href="http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=0200000301">San Francisco Historical
  Photograph Collection</a>. They were culled from many sources, including the
  now-defunct <a
  href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2r29n63p">San
  Francisco News-Call Bulletin</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The Library retains the copyright for many of these images. For details,
  please read their <a
  href="http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000017301">Permissions</a> page and <a
  href="http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000073201">FAQ</a>.</p>

  <p>The creators of this site did not collect or digitize any of these images
  &mdash; credit for that massive undertaking belongs entirely to the
  Library.</p>

  <h3 style="clear:both;">Who built this site?</h3>
  <p>The site was built by <a
  href="http://twitter.com/#!/danvdk">@danvdk</a> and designed/built by <a
  href="http://twitter.com/#!/ravejk">@ravejk</a>.</p>

  <h3>What did this site do?</h3>
  <p>The creators of this site associated <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitudes</a> and <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitudes</a> to the images in
  the San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection. This process is known as <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">geocoding</a>. Doing this
  allows the images to be placed at points on a map, which enables new ways of
  exploring this collection.</p>

  <h3>How were they geocoded?</h3>
  <p>The geocodes are based on two sources:
  <ol>
    <li>Photo Subjects. All photographs in the &ldquo;City Hall (old)&rdquo;
    series presumably belong in the same place. We manually geocoded several
    hundred subjects.</li>

    <li>Addresses and Cross-Streets. The photo descriptions often contain
    either an address, block number or set of cross-streets. These were
    converted to coordinates using the <a
    href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Google
    Geocoding API</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What's the story of this project?</h3>
  <a href="/#e:AAB-5616|625,ll:37.771393|-122.428618,m:37.77190|-122.42891|16"><img src="/1945.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 5px; padding-right: 0;" width=400 border=0 /></a>
  <p>Several years ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danvdk">@danvdk</a> searched for his <a
  href="http://sflib1.sfpl.org:82/search~S0/?searchtype=X&searcharg=%22webster%22+waller&sortdropdown=-&SORT=D&extended=0&SUBMIT=Search&searchlimits=&searchorigarg=X%22webster%22+waller%26SORT%3DD">cross-streets</a>
  on the Library's San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection and found the
  photo on the right. The image was mislabeled &mdash; the intersection in the
  foreground is actually Waller and Fillmore, not Waller and Webster. Which
  meant that this photo from 1945 was taken from his roof!</p>

  <p>He put together a <a
  href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/2008-12-02/now-and-then/">now-and-then</a>
  shot, but it always bothered him that the mislabeling of the image was so
  crucial to my finding it. This led to the idea of putting the images on a
  map.</p>
  
  <p>And now, years later, we have that map!</p>

  <h3>What fraction of the images have been geocoded?</h3>
  <p>The library's collection contains about 40,000 images. Many of these
  photographs have little geographic context (e.g. they're portraits) and
  cannot be located. In all, about 20,000 of the images could be placed on a
  map. We've geocoded about 65% of the possible images: 13,000.</p>

  <h3>How can you help?</h3>
  <p>If you're technically minded, here's a JSON file containing all the image
  descriptions, as well as geocodes for the records on the map (including the
  reason we thought they were at that location): <a
    href="/records.js.zip">records.js.zip</a> (2MB download). If you improve
  on my geocoding or do something else interesting with the data, please share
  your results!</p>
